# pattern-iqa

How similar are two patterns? This toolbox uses five image quality assessment tools to determine the degree of similarity
between two patterns (a.k.a. images, two-dimensional arrays). In particular I am exploring which terrain products (a DEM,
various DEM derivatives, roughness indices, etc.) are most similar to windblown snow cover created by drifting and scouring.
